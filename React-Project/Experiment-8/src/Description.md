## ðŸ“– Library Management System - React Project

This React-based project is a Library Management System that allows users to manage a collection of books with interactive features, including search, add, and remove functionality. The project demonstrates core React concepts like component-based architecture, state management, and event handling.

-----

### Project Overview

**Tech Stack:**

  * **Frontend:** React.js (using Vite for a fast build)
  * **Styling:** HTML5 and CSS (`App.css`)

**Core Concepts:**

  * **Components:** Reusable building blocks such as `SearchBar`, `AddBookForm`, and `BookList`.
  * **Props:** Data is passed between parent and child components.
  * **State (`useState`):** Dynamic data (books, search text) is stored and updated.
  * **Events:** Handles user interactions like button clicks and input changes.

### Functionality

1.  **Add Book:**

      * Input fields for **Title** and **Author** are in `AddBookForm.jsx`.
      * Clicking **"Add Book"** calls the `addBook()` function in `Library.jsx`.
      * A new book object `{ title, author }` is created and appended to the existing `books` state.
      * The UI automatically updates to display the new book.

2.  **Remove Book:**

      * Each book in `BookList.jsx` has a **"Remove"** button.
      * Clicking it calls `handleRemoveBook(id)` from `Library.jsx`, which filters the book out of the list.
      * The UI updates instantly.

3.  **Search Book:**

      * A search input field is in `SearchBar.jsx`.
      * Typing in the field updates the `searchTerm` state in `Library.jsx`.
      * The book list is filtered to display only matching books.

4.  **Book Display:**

      * A clean, card-based layout shows a list of books with bolded titles and author information in the format *"by [Author Name]"*.

### Usage Instructions

1.  **SEARCH:** Type in the search box to filter books by title or author.
2.  **ADD:** Enter a new book's title and author, then click **"Add Book"**.
3.  **REMOVE:** Click the **"Remove"** button next to any book to delete it.
4.  All changes happen instantly without page reloads.
